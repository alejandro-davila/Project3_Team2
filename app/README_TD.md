1. Visualization Project:
Title:
“Navigating Green: A Deep Dive into Alternative Fuel Stations”

Objective:
To visualize the distribution, type, and availability of alternative fuel stations across the United States.

2. Project Components:
a. Flask-Powered API:
Create endpoints to serve processed and aggregated data to the frontend.
Perform data manipulations and filtering based on user input.
b. HTML/CSS/JavaScript:
Design an intuitive and responsive user interface.
Implement user-driven interactions using JavaScript to update visualizations dynamically.
c. Database:
Consider using MongoDB as it is more flexible with the schema-less approach, and the data from the API can be stored as JSON documents.
3. Visualizations & User Interactions:
a. Map Visualization (Leaflet):
Display the locations of alternative fuel stations on an interactive map.
Use color-coding or different markers to represent the different types of fuel available.
Allow users to filter stations by fuel type, state, or other attributes.
b. Data-driven Dashboard (Plotly/D3.js):
Display multiple charts summarizing the availability of different fuel types, number of stations per state, etc.
Create interactive dropdowns or menus allowing users to select specific states or fuel types to update all the charts simultaneously.
c. Custom Visualization (Using a new JS Library):
Explore a new visualization library such as Chart.js or Highcharts to create unique visual representations of the data.
Represent user-driven aggregated data like the ratio of fuel types in selected states, average number of stations per city, etc.
d. Web Scraping:
Complement the API data by scraping additional information about the alternative fuel industry, like news articles, or market trends, and display it on the webpage.
4. User-Driven Interaction:
a. Interactive Filters:
Create dropdown menus or checkboxes for users to filter the visualizations by fuel type, state, etc.
b. Search & Display:
Allow users to search for specific stations and display detailed information about the selected station.
c. Dynamic Updating:
Ensure that the visualizations update dynamically based on user interaction without the need to refresh the page.
5. Additional Ideas:
a. Comparative Analysis:
Compare

run.py will be used to run the application.
routes.py will contain all the Flask routes and API endpoints.
models.py will contain the database model(s) if you are using an ORM like SQLAlchemy.
index.html will be the main HTML file.
