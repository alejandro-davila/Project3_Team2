            I am proud of my role as an educator, leading a dedicated crew of aerospace students on an exhilarating rocket launch mission in Stonewall, TX. Our challenge was to launch "Bad Piggy," a rocket we built, aiming to reach within 100 feet of a mile high while carrying a 1-pound payload. Through the SystemsGo program, I've nurtured these students, teaching STEM through rocketry. Despite challenges, our resilience and enthusiasm prevailed. Some students now pursue careers in aerospace, and my personal achievement includes graduating from the University of A&M in Electrical Engineering in 2018, enriching my mentoring role.
