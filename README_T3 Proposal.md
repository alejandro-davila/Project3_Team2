# Project3_Team2
# 1. Introduction
We propose the development of a web application that provides users with a convenient way to locate and compare petrol, diesel, and electric charging stations. This application will empower users to make informed decisions about their refueling needs, including finding the nearest stations, checking pricing, and viewing payment methods accepted.


# 2. Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive and user-friendly web interface that allows users to easily select their preferred engine type (gasoline, diesel, or electric).
Location-Based Search: Implement a location-based search feature that enables users to find nearby fuel and charging stations based on their current location or a specified address.
Display Station Details: Provide detailed information about each station, including its name, address, available fuel types, pricing, and accepted payment methods.
Filter and Sorting Options: Allow users to filter search results by fuel type, price and range.
Real-Time Data: Ensure that station data, including pricing and payment methods, are up-to-date and accurate through regular data updates from reliable sources.
Maps Integration: Display station locations on an interactive map using a popular mapping service (e.g., OpenStreetMap.org) for easy navigation.


# 3. Technical Stack
The following technology stack is proposed for the development of the web application:
Frontend:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Mapping integration (e.g., OpenStreetMap.org)
Backend:
Python
PostgreSQL 
Data Sources:
APIs for station data retrieval (National Renewable Energy Laboratory API)
Utilize APIs or web scraping for data collection. (BeautifulSoup)


# 4. Implementation Phases
The project will be divided into several phases to ensure a systematic development process:
Requirements Gathering: Collaborate with potential users to gather detailed requirements and refine the project scope.
Design and Prototyping: Create mockups for the user interface, design the database schema.
Frontend Development: Develop the user interface, and integrate mapping services.
Backend Development: Create APIs for data retrieval  and implement database functionality.
Data Integration: Partner with data providers to integrate real-time station data into the application.
Testing: Conduct thorough testing, including functional testing, usability testing, and security testing.
Deployment: Deploy the web application on the Github.io platform.


# 5. Conclusion
The Fuel and Charging Station Locator web application will offer a valuable service to users, helping them find and compare petrol, diesel, and electric charging stations conveniently. The project aims to provide accurate and up-to-date information while ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience. We believe this project will fill a significant need in the market and contribute to environmental sustainability by promoting electric vehicle usage.
